# 🧠 INTELLIGENT POWER MODE - Complex Query & Multi-Tool Orchestration

## 🎯 **New Design Philosophy**

**POWER mode is now designed for complex, reasoning-heavy queries** that require:
- **Intelligent tool selection** (LLM decides which tools to use)
- **Multi-tool orchestration** (parallel or sequential execution)
- **Context-aware processing** (tools can use results from previous tools)
- **Intelligent response synthesis** (LLM combines tool results intelligently)

**For simple queries, use Normal mode. For complex queries, use POWER mode!**

## 🚀 **New Architecture Components**

### **1. 🧠 Intelligent Tool Selection**
```typescript
// LLM analyzes query and selects appropriate tools
const selectedTools = await this.intelligentlySelectTools(userQuery, tools, agentType);

// Example: "What's the weather and time?" → ["getCurrentDateTime", "getCurrentWeather"]
// Example: "Search for AI news and analyze trends" → ["tavilySearch", "retrieveRelevantChunks"]
// Example: "Just tell me the time" → ["getCurrentDateTime"]
```

**Features:**
- **Context-aware selection** - understands what the user actually needs
- **Efficiency optimization** - uses minimal tools to get the job done
- **Smart fallbacks** - if LLM selection fails, uses all available tools

### **2. 🎭 Smart Tool Orchestration**
```typescript
// Two execution strategies:
if (canExecuteInParallel(selectedTools)) {
  // 🚀 PARALLEL EXECUTION - Independent tools run simultaneously
  strategy = "parallel";
} else {
  // 🚀 SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION - Tools run in sequence with context passing
  strategy = "sequential";
}
```

**Parallel Execution:**
- **Independent tools** run simultaneously (e.g., time + weather)
- **Better performance** for non-dependent operations
- **Automatic detection** of parallel-safe tools

**Sequential Execution:**
- **Context passing** - each tool can use previous tool's results
- **Dependent operations** - tools that build on each other
- **Intelligent chaining** - results flow from one tool to the next

### **3. 🧠 Intelligent Response Synthesis**
```typescript
// LLM combines tool results into coherent response
const synthesizedResponse = await this.synthesizeResponse(userQuery, toolResults, agentType);
```

**Features:**
- **Context-aware synthesis** - understands the user's original query
- **Insight extraction** - highlights key findings and patterns
- **Actionable information** - provides useful next steps when possible
- **Conversational tone** - maintains helpful, engaging responses

## 🎯 **Use Cases for Intelligent POWER Mode**

### **🔍 Complex Research Queries**
```
Query: "Research the latest AI developments and analyze their impact on job markets"

POWER Mode Processing:
1. 🧠 LLM selects: ["tavilySearch", "retrieveRelevantChunks"]
2. 🎭 Sequential execution with context passing
3. 🧠 Intelligent synthesis of search results + document analysis
4. 📊 Response: Comprehensive analysis with insights and trends
```

### **⚡ Multi-Tool Operations**
```
Query: "What's the weather like and what time is it? Also search for local events"

POWER Mode Processing:
1. 🧠 LLM selects: ["getCurrentDateTime", "getCurrentWeather", "tavilySearch"]
2. 🚀 Parallel execution (time + weather) + sequential (search with context)
3. 🧠 Intelligent synthesis combining all information
4. 📊 Response: Coordinated information about time, weather, and local events
```

### **🎯 Planning & Analysis**
```
Query: "Plan a comprehensive research project on climate change"

POWER Mode Processing:
1. 🧠 LLM selects: ["retrieveRelevantChunks", "tavilySearch", "getCurrentDateTime"]
2. 🎭 Sequential execution with progressive context building
3. 🧠 Intelligent synthesis into actionable project plan
4. 📊 Response: Structured research plan with timelines and resources
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Tool Selection Intelligence**
```typescript
const prompt = `You are an intelligent tool selector for a ${agentType} agent. 
Analyze the user's query and select the most appropriate tools to answer it.

Available tools: ${availableTools.map(t => `- ${t.name}: ${t.description}`).join('\n')}

Select tools based on:
1. **Relevance** - Does the tool directly help answer the query?
2. **Efficiency** - Use minimal tools to get the job done
3. **Context** - Consider what information the user needs

Respond with ONLY a JSON array of tool names to use, like: ["tool1", "tool2"]`;
```

### **Orchestration Strategies**
```typescript
// Parallel execution for independent tools
const independentTools = ["getCurrentDateTime", "getCurrentWeather"];
const canExecuteInParallel = tools.every(tool => independentTools.includes(tool.name));

if (canExecuteInParallel) {
  // Execute simultaneously for better performance
  const parallelResults = await Promise.all(tools.map(tool => tool.invoke()));
} else {
  // Execute sequentially with context passing
  let context = userQuery;
  for (const tool of tools) {
    const result = await tool.invoke({ input: context });
    context = `${userQuery}\n\nPrevious result: ${result}`;
  }
}
```

### **Response Synthesis**
```typescript
const prompt = `You are an intelligent response synthesizer. Combine the results from multiple tools into a coherent, helpful response.

User Query: "${userQuery}"

Tool Results:
${Object.entries(toolResults).map(([tool, result]) => `- ${tool}: ${result}`).join('\n')}

Your task:
1. **Analyze** the tool results in context of the user query
2. **Synthesize** the information into a coherent response
3. **Highlight** key insights and findings
4. **Provide** actionable information when possible
5. **Maintain** a conversational, helpful tone`;
```

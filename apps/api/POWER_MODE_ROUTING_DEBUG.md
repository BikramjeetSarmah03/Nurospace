# 🔍 POWER MODE ROUTING DEBUG GUIDE

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

**Mixed Query Still Routing to Wrong Agent:**
```
Query: "wcurrent time and latest news on assam"
→ Still routing to execution agent (wrong!)
→ Should route to research agent
```

## 🔧 **Debug Fixes Implemented**

### **1. ✅ Enhanced Pattern Routing Logic**
- **Added comprehensive logging** to see exactly what's happening
- **Added explicit blocking** for mixed/complex queries
- **Added word count analysis** to detect complex queries

### **2. ✅ Added Debug Logging**
```typescript
console.log(`[HYBRID] 🔍 Pattern routing analysis for: "${query}"`);
console.log(`[HYBRID] 🔍 Normalized: "${normalizedQuery}"`);
console.log(`[HYBRID] 🔍 Word count: ${normalizedQuery.split(' ').length}`);
console.log(`[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'and': ${normalizedQuery.includes(' and ')}`);
console.log(`[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'news': ${normalizedQuery.includes('news')}`);
console.log(`[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'latest': ${normalizedQuery.includes('latest')}`);
console.log(`[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'assam': ${normalizedQuery.includes('assam')}`);
```

### **3. ✅ Added Explicit Blocking**
```typescript
// 🚫 BLOCK execution routing for mixed/complex queries
if (normalizedQuery.includes(' and ') || 
    normalizedQuery.includes('news') || 
    normalizedQuery.includes('search') || 
    normalizedQuery.includes('find') || 
    normalizedQuery.includes('research') ||
    normalizedQuery.includes('latest') ||
    normalizedQuery.includes('assam') ||
    normalizedQuery.split(' ').length > 5) {
  
  console.log(`[HYBRID] 🚫 Blocking execution routing - mixed/complex query detected`);
  return null; // Let function calling handle it
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Debug Fixes**

**Restart your API server** and test with the same query:

```
"wcurrent time and latest news on assam"
```

### **Expected Debug Output:**
```
[HYBRID] 🔍 Pattern routing analysis for: "wcurrent time and latest news on assam"
[HYBRID] 🔍 Normalized: "wcurrent time and latest news on assam"
[HYBRID] 🔍 Word count: 7
[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'and': true
[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'news': true
[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'latest': true
[HYBRID] 🔍 Contains 'assam': true
[HYBRID] 🚫 Blocking execution routing - mixed/complex query detected
[HYBRID] 🔍 Pattern route result: null
[HYBRID] ⚡ Using TIER 2: Function calling routing
[HYBRID] 🎯 Function calling selected agent: research
```

### **What Should Happen Now:**
1. **Pattern routing** should detect mixed query and return `null`
2. **Function calling** should take over and select research agent
3. **Research agent** should use intelligent tool selection
4. **Response** should include both time and news research

---

## 🎯 **Why This Should Work Now**

### **Query Analysis:**
- **"wcurrent time and latest news on assam"**
- **Word count**: 7 (complex query)
- **Contains**: "and", "news", "latest", "assam"
- **Result**: Should be blocked from execution routing

### **Routing Flow:**
1. **Pattern routing** → detects mixed query → returns `null`
2. **Function calling** → LLM analyzes query → selects research agent
3. **Research agent** → intelligent tool selection → comprehensive response

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Restart your API server** to load the debug fixes
2. **Test the same query**: `"wcurrent time and latest news on assam"`
3. **Check logs** for the detailed debug output
4. **Verify** that it now routes to research agent

---

## 🔍 **If It Still Doesn't Work**

The debug logs will show us exactly where the issue is:

- **If pattern routing still returns 'execution'**: The blocking logic isn't working
- **If function calling isn't being used**: There's an issue with the tier selection
- **If function calling selects wrong agent**: The LLM prompt needs improvement

---

## 🎉 **Expected Result**

**After the debug fixes:**
- ✅ **Mixed queries** → research agent (intelligent, comprehensive)
- ✅ **Simple queries** → execution agent (fast, efficient)
- ✅ **Complex queries** → research agent (intelligent, comprehensive)
- ✅ **Clear logging** showing exactly what's happening

**Test it out and let me know what the debug logs show!** 🚀
